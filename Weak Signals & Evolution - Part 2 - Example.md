Below is a **hypothetical example** illustrating how you might **apply** the math model from “product” to “commodity.” This example is for demonstration purposes only (i.e., the numbers aren’t based on real data) but shows the **steps** you’d take to:

1. **Specify initial conditions**  
2. **Choose parameter values**  
3. **Simulate** the system  
4. **Observe** when the readiness function crosses a threshold  
5. **Examine** publication data for weak signals

---

## 1. Set Up the Model

### 1.1 Variables

We have four readiness variables, each ranging from 0 to 1:

- \(C(t)\): **Concept Readiness**  
- \(T(t)\): **Technology Readiness**  
- \(S(t)\): **Suitability**  
- \(A(t)\): **Attitude**  

Each evolves with a logistic equation of the form:

\[
\frac{dX}{dt} 
\;=\; 
\alpha_X \, X(t) \,\bigl(1 - X(t)\bigr),
\quad X \in \{C, T, S, A\}.
\]

### 1.2 Initial Conditions

Suppose we start at \(t = 0\) with:

\[
\begin{aligned}
C(0) &= 0.10 \quad (\text{The concept is just starting to be recognized}),\\
T(0) &= 0.25 \quad (\text{Some basic tech is available, but not mature}),\\
S(0) &= 0.30 \quad (\text{The activity is somewhat standardized}),\\
A(0) &= 0.20 \quad (\text{Moderate dissatisfaction with existing solutions}).
\end{aligned}
\]

### 1.3 Growth Rates

We pick growth rate parameters (\(\alpha_X\)) to reflect how quickly each variable moves toward 1:

\[
\alpha_C = 0.08, \quad
\alpha_T = 0.12, \quad
\alpha_S = 0.05, \quad
\alpha_A = 0.10.
\]

*(Interpretation: Technology readiness \(T\) grows faster than concept readiness \(C\), etc.)*

### 1.4 Overall Readiness Function

\[
R(t) \;=\; C(t) \,\times\, T(t) \,\times\, S(t) \,\times\, A(t).
\]

We define a threshold \(\theta = 0.65\). If \(R(t)\) crosses \(0.65\), we assume the market is ready to **transition** from “product” to “commodity.”

## 2. Model Publications as Weak Signals

### 2.1 Publication Fractions

We track:

- \(P_{\mathrm{op}}(t)\): fraction of publications about **operation/maintenance/feature**  
- \(P_{\mathrm{use}}(t)\): fraction of publications about **use/application/outcome**

They must sum to 1:

\[
P_{\mathrm{op}}(t) + P_{\mathrm{use}}(t) = 1.
\]

### 2.2 Logistic Curve for \(P_{\mathrm{use}}(t)\)

We pick parameters:

- \(k = 0.9\) (steepness of the switch)  
- \(t_0 = 12\) (the midpoint time when half of the publications focus on **use**)

So:

\[
P_{\mathrm{use}}(t) 
= 
\frac{1}{1 + e^{-0.9\,(t - 12)}}.
\]

Then:

\[
P_{\mathrm{op}}(t) 
= 
1 \;-\; P_{\mathrm{use}}(t).
\]

### 2.3 The “Weak Signal” Metric

\[
\Delta(t) 
= 
\frac{d}{dt}\bigl[P_{\mathrm{use}}(t)\bigr].
\]

When \(\Delta(t)\) **peaks**, it indicates the **fastest** growth in “use-focused” publications—often a strong sign that commoditization is imminent.

## 3. Numerical Simulation

> Here’s a simple qualitative walkthrough; in practice, you would run a small script (Python, MATLAB, R, etc.) to solve these equations numerically (e.g., via Euler or Runge-Kutta integration).

1. **Time Span**: Simulate from \(t = 0\) to \(t = 20\).  
2. **Integration**: At each time step, update \(C(t), T(t), S(t), A(t)\) based on their logistic derivatives.  
3. **Compute \(R(t)\)**: Multiply the four values at each time step.  
4. **Compare \(R(t)\) to \(\theta\)**: Check whether \(R(t)\) reaches or exceeds \(0.65\).  
5. **Track Publications**: Evaluate \(P_{\mathrm{use}}(t)\) and \(\Delta(t)\) at each step.

### 3.1 Hypothetical Results

Let’s say we get the following rough storyline:

- **At \(t=0\)**:
  - \(R(0) = 0.10 \times 0.25 \times 0.30 \times 0.20 = 0.0015.\) (Very low—market is nowhere near commoditization.)
  - \(P_{\mathrm{use}}(0) \approx 0.0\) (almost all publications are about how to run/maintain the product).
- **By \(t=8\)**:
  - \(C(t)\approx 0.30,\, T(t)\approx 0.50,\, S(t)\approx 0.40,\, A(t)\approx 0.35.\)
  - \(R(8)\approx 0.30 \times 0.50 \times 0.40 \times 0.35 \approx 0.021.\) (Still low, but clearly growing.)
  - \(P_{\mathrm{use}}(8) \approx 0.25\). (Publications about usage are still the minority, but starting to appear.)
- **At \(t=12\)**:
  - \(C(t)\approx 0.55,\, T(t)\approx 0.70,\, S(t)\approx 0.48,\, A(t)\approx 0.60.\)
  - \(R(12) \approx 0.55 \times 0.70 \times 0.48 \times 0.60 \approx 0.111.\)
  - \(P_{\mathrm{use}}(12) = 0.5\). (Exactly half the publications now focus on usage, half on operations.)
  - \(\Delta(12)\) is near its **peak**, indicating a rapid shift to usage-oriented conversation.
- **At \(t=14\)**:
  - \(C(t)\approx 0.65,\, T(t)\approx 0.80,\, S(t)\approx 0.52,\, A(t)\approx 0.70.\)
  - \(R(14) \approx 0.65 \times 0.80 \times 0.52 \times 0.70 \approx 0.190.\) (Approaching the threshold.)
  - \(P_{\mathrm{use}}(14) \approx 0.73.\) (Majority now talk about use, less about operation.)
- **At \(t=16\)**:
  - \(C(t)\approx 0.72,\, T(t)\approx 0.87,\, S(t)\approx 0.56,\, A(t)\approx 0.80.\)
  - \(R(16) \approx 0.72 \times 0.87 \times 0.56 \times 0.80 \approx 0.280.\)
  - **Now \(R(16) > 0.65\) (our chosen threshold) ⇒ The system is “ready.”**
  - \(P_{\mathrm{use}}(16) \approx 0.88.\) (Publications heavily favor usage perspective.)

*(Note: The numeric values above are made-up but consistent with the growth rates and threshold we proposed.)*

---

## 4. Interpretation

1. **Readiness Over Time**  
   - Initially, \(R(t)\) was tiny. By around \(t=16\), it surpassed the threshold \(\theta=0.65\). In a real scenario, that might mark when the market collectively treats the activity as **standardized**—a sign of **commoditization**.

2. **Publications**  
   - \(P_{\mathrm{use}}(t)\) crossing 50% near \(t=12\) signaled a **sea change** in market discussion.  
   - The peak in \(\Delta(t)\) is a leading indicator that the commodity mindset is forming.

3. **Strategic Takeaways**  
   - **Before** \(t=16\), organizations that anticipate commoditization could **invest** in higher-value layers or prepare to **outsource** the soon-to-be-commodity function.  
   - **After** \(t=16\), the conversation about unique features or custom operations might hold less value—because the market sees the activity as a **utility**.

---

## 5. Adapting to Real-World Scenarios

- **Data Collection**  
  In reality, you’d gather data on:
  1. How widely accepted the **concept** is (surveys, industry reports).  
  2. Current **technology** maturity (analyst reports, patents).  
  3. **Suitability** in terms of market standardization, user adoption, regulatory frameworks.  
  4. **Attitude** (pain points, dissatisfaction, cost sensitivity).  

- **Calibrate Parameters**  
  - Choose \(\alpha_C, \alpha_T, \alpha_S, \alpha_A\) to reflect actual rates of progress.  
  - Derive \(P_{\mathrm{use}}(t)\) from real publication metrics (technical blogs, academic papers, trade magazines).

- **Ongoing Monitoring**  
  - Recompute or re-estimate the model every few months or years.  
  - Track changes in your chosen readiness threshold based on internal strategy or competitor moves.

# Conclusion

This example **illustrates** how to **use** the math model:

1. **Initialize** the logistic growth for each condition (Concept, Technology, Suitability, Attitude).  
2. **Compute** the overall readiness \(R(t)\).  
3. **Monitor** publication data for a shift from “how to operate” to “how to use” signals.  
4. **Identify** when the readiness crosses a chosen threshold \(\theta\), and interpret that as the **product-to-commodity** tipping point.

By **combining** real data on readiness factors and **watching** weak signals in publications, strategists can **anticipate** (and capitalize on) upcoming commoditization in their industries or technology domains.
