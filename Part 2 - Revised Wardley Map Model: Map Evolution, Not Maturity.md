# Explaining the “API Monetisation” Wardley Map via the Mathematical Model

Below is a step-by-step explanation of the provided Wardley Map using our **mathematical framework** for Wardley Maps. Recall the two core axes:

- **Vertical (Value Chain / Visibility)**: 
  > ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_i%20%3D%20V(c_i))  
  typically measured by **distance from the User**—more visible components are near the top, more “invisible” or back-end components near the bottom.

- **Horizontal (Evolution)**:

  representing movement from **Genesis** (left) → **Commodity** (right), driven by how **ubiquitous** and **well-understood** each component is in the broader market.

## 1. Identifying the Main Clusters on the Map

1. **Top / Visible**  
   - **User**, **Developer**, **API Publisher**, **Application**, **Payments**, **Custom GPT**  
   These are highly visible in delivering value. They appear near the top on the vertical axis:
   - A short *graph distance* from the end user (User → Developer/Payments, etc.).
   - Therefore, their vertical coordinate ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_i) is relatively **high**.

2. **Bottom / Less Visible**  
   - **Python Code**, **Prompts**, **LLM** (Large Language Model), **Development Machine**, **Linux**, **Cloud**  
   These are “behind the scenes” or infrastructural pieces, far from direct end-user awareness, placed lower on the vertical axis. 
   - A longer *distance* from user-facing nodes → lower ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V(c_i)).

3. **Intermediate / Mid-Stack**  
   - Tools & frameworks like **LangChain**, **LangSmith**, **OpenAPI Generator**, **FastAPI**, **Authentication** (Clerk), etc.  
   They’re consumed by developers or the application but not typically by end users directly, so they land somewhere in the middle on visibility.

## 2. Evolution (Left to Right)

### Left Side: **Genesis / Custom-Built**  
- **Python Code**, **Prompts**, **wardleymap Python Package**  
  - These appear at or near **Genesis** or **Custom-Built**. Possibly:
    - **Limited ubiquity** (not widely packaged as an “out-of-the-box” solution).  
    - **Lower certainty** (still specialized or custom usage).

### Middle: **Products**  
- **LangChain**, **LangSmith**, **OpenAPI Generator**, **FastAPI**  
  - These are known libraries or frameworks. Their:
    - **Ubiquity**: moderate (growing developer communities).
    - **Certainty**: moderate (they have established best practices but are still evolving).  
  - Hence, they’re placed in the **Product** range—beyond pure custom but not fully commoditized.

### Right Side: **Commodity / Utility**  
- **Cloud**, **DNS**, **Linux**, **Stripe** (payments), **OpenAI** (arguably becoming standard for AI), **Java**  
  - Common, widely-available, well-understood, reliable solutions.  
  - **High ubiquity** + **high certainty** → near the **Commodity** edge.

## 3. Placing Components Using Our Formulas

For each component ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c_i):

1. **Visibility**  
   ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_i%20%3D%20V(c_i)%20%3D%201%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bdist%7D(c_i)%7D%7B%5Cmax_%7Bc_j%7D%20%5Cmathrm%7Bdist%7D(c_j)%7D).  
   - If “dist” = *graph distance* to the User node, then `Python Code` (several steps away) gets a lower \(y_i\) than `Documentation` (fewer steps away).

2. **Evolution**  
   ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_i%20%3D%20E(c_i)%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bubiq%7D(c_i)%20+%20%5Cmathrm%7Bcert%7D(c_i)%7D%7B2%7D).  
   - `Cloud`: High ubiquity (used worldwide) + high certainty (stable best practices) → \(x_i \approx 1.0\).  
   - `Prompts`: Possibly custom, experimental, less standardized → \(x_i \approx 0.2\) or 0.3, more to the left.

## 4. Dependency Lines

Each line shows **which components depend on which**. For example:
- **“Application” depends on “API Gateway,” “Authentication,” and “Payments.”**  
  - In the graph model, that means `(Application, Payments) ∈ E` or `(App, Gateway) ∈ E`, etc.  
- The lines from **Python Code** to **Prompts** show how the code might rely on custom prompt logic.  

When reading the map:
- Start from the **top** (User, Developer) and trace downward to see **what** each user-facing service depends upon, eventually reaching **commodities** (Cloud, Linux, DNS) at the bottom right.

## 5. Key Takeaways

1. **User-Facing vs. Infrastructure**  
   - Top nodes (e.g., “User,” “Developer,” “Payments,” “API Publisher”) are highly visible, short distance to user → near top of the map.

2. **Novel / Custom vs. Commodity**  
   - Left side (e.g., “Python Code,” “Prompts”) → more custom, less standardized.  
   - Right side (e.g., “Cloud,” “DNS,” “Stripe”) → widely available, well-understood.

3. **Strategic Considerations**  
   - **Invest or Differentiate** in items more to the left (e.g., your unique AI prompts, custom GPT workflows).  
   - **Leverage or Outsource** items on the right (e.g., major cloud providers, open-source standards) since they’re commodity-like.

## 6. Conclusion

Using the math model:

1. **Vertical**:  
   ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_i%20%3D%20V(c_i))  
   is determined by the “distance to the user”—the fewer edges from “User,” the higher up you appear.

2. **Horizontal**:  
   ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_i%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bubiq%7D(c_i)%20+%20%5Cmathrm%7Bcert%7D(c_i)%7D%7B2%7D)  
   is driven by supply/demand competition: how **ubiquitous** and **certain** a component has become in the market.

In this **API Monetisation** map, you can see:
- **High-visibility** items near the top (Developer, User, Documentation).  
- **Core infrastructure** and **utilities** near the bottom-right (Cloud, DNS, Linux).  
- **Mid-level frameworks** scattered around the mid-to-right range (FastAPI, LangChain, OpenAPI Generator) as they’re semi-standard but still evolving.
